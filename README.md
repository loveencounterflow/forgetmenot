## Creating a New Memo Object

* `path` is interpreted relative to current working directory (CWD)
* ... but `globs` are relative to the memo's location


-->

## ToDo

* [X] honor earlier dates as present in the file system
* [ ] add `ref`erence point for paths: either CWD or `*.forgetmenot` ('blurb') location
* [ ] change name of `new_cache`
* [ ] naming of `cache` argument in `new_cache` is not clear; also naming of `path` attribute
